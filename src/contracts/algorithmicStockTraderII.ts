// Algorithmic Stock Trader II
// You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, after which the 
// contract will self-destruct.

// You are given the following array of stock prices (which are numbers) where the i-th element 
// represents the stock price on day i:

// 191,27,7,14,40,176,15,74,157,111,119,115,77,27,85,178,194,177,122,68,36,48,103,67,75,195,35,146,52

// Determine the maximum possible profit you can earn using as many transactions as you'd like. 
// A transaction is defined as buying and then selling one share of the stock. Note that you cannot 
// engage in multiple transactions at once. In other words, you must sell the stock before you buy it again.

// If no profit can be made, then the answer should be 0.

// If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty. Do not use "", '', or ``.
