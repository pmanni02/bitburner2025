// Merge Overlapping Intervals
// You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 15 tries remaining, after which the contract will self-destruct.

// Given the following array of arrays of numbers representing a list of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

// [[4,7],[1,7],[21,30],[9,19],[1,11],[6,9],[17,18],[18,26],[19,21],[10,15],[22,28],[12,20],[4,8],[15,22],[1,9],[9,16]]

// Example:

// [[1, 3], [8, 10], [2, 6], [10, 16]]

// would merge into [[1, 6], [8, 16]].

// The intervals must be returned in ASCENDING order. You can assume that in an interval, the first number will always be smaller than the second.


// If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty. Do not use "", '', or ``.
