// Generate IP Addresses
// You are attempting to solve a Coding Contract. You have 10 tries remaining, 
// after which the contract will self-destruct.

// Given the following string containing only digits, return an array with all possible 
// valid IP address combinations that can be created from the string:

// 18214757196

// Note that an octet cannot begin with a '0' unless the number itself is exactly '0'. 
// For example, '192.168.010.1' is not a valid IP.

// Examples:

// 25525511135 -> ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]
// 1938718066 -> ["193.87.180.66"]
// 1111 -> ["1.1.1.1"]

// If your solution is an empty string, you must leave the text box empty. Do not use "", '', or ``.
